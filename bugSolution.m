The solution involves a minor modification to the custom setter to only update the weak reference if the new value is different from the existing value. This prevents the accidental release of the object if the setter is called with the same value.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject

@property (nonatomic, weak) NSString *myString;

@end

@implementation MyClass

- (void)setMyString:(NSString *)myString {
    if (myString != _myString) { // Only update if different
        _myString = myString; 
    }
}

@end
```
By adding this simple check, we guarantee that the weak reference is only updated when necessary, preventing premature release and resolving the memory management issue.
